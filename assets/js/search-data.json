Unit 2 . Objects are instances Methods have to specify return type which can be void, or nothing Static methods tied with the class and defined once across all instances Method overloading is when multiple methods with the same name have different parameters . Unit 4 . While loops run when conditional is true For loops defines a variable that changes every loop and runs when the conditional is true Nested iteration can be good in situations Enhanced for loops can loop through all elements in an array but the array cannot be modified when it is looping . Unit 5 . Classes have properties and methods Properties store information about each object private and public Methods runs code Getter and setter methods are coded to modify private attributes . Unit 6 . Arrays are objects defined by type[] name = new type[size] or initialized with elements using type[] name = new type[]{a,b,c,…} Loops an enhanced can iterate through arrays Index goes from 0 to size-1 Algorithms can be used to modify or get info about arrays .",

Good if you have no work experience . | . | Internships, September and November open . | . Insights . This panel really helped me to see how practical CS is in a variety of majors. Computer Science really can be applied to anything. I really resonated with Allison choosing talking about Cognitive Science. I never knew that you could major psychology with computer science. I will definitely check out the other submajors for computer science and choose one that I enjoy doing. I am leaning towards cybersecurity + comp sci rn. In addition, it was comforting knowing that others also faced many challenges in computer science. I liked how Anthony brought up his challenge of looking through other people’s Linkedins and feeling like he wasn’t good enough. His advice on just focusing on what you are doing is really good and beneficial to me. It was also interesting learning what the interns at Northrop Grumman do. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
