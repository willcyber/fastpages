## Unit 1

- casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type. In integer division, the decimal is truncated. You need to use a double in order to keep the decimal
- casting rounds down while Math.round rounds to the nearest int

int, boolean, char, and double are primitives
Strings and other classes are objects
Compare primitives with == and objects with .equals()
Objects have properties while primitives do not

## Unit 2

- Wrapper classes allow you to use primatives as objects. One use case would be in arraylists, where only objects are stored. Ex: ArrayList<Integer> myNumbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); 
- Concatanation is when you combine primatives together. For example, you would use the .append for combining two strings. You could use "+" to add together integers and doubles. You can concatanate a string with an integer through "+".
- Math.round rounds to the nearest int
- Math.random gives a random number between two numbers


Objects are instances
Methods have to specify return type which can be void, or nothing
Static methods tied with the class and defined once across all instances
Method overloading is when multiple methods with the same name have different parameters


## Unit 3
- Compound boolean values uses logical operators AND and OR to evaulate an expression as true or false
- 


## Unit 4

While loops run when conditional is true
For loops defines a variable that changes every loop and runs when the conditional is true
Nested iteration can be good in situations
Enhanced for loops can loop through all elements in an array but the array cannot be modified when it is looping

## Unit 5

Classes have properties and methods
Properties store information about each object
private and public
Methods runs code
Getter and setter methods are coded to modify private attributes

## Unit 6

Arrays are objects defined by type[] name = new type[size] or initialized with elements using type[] name = new type[]{a,b,c,...}
Loops an enhanced can iterate through arrays
Index goes from 0 to size-1
Algorithms can be used to modify or get info about arrays

## Unit 7
- Wrapper class stores prim in objects
- make sure to specify the data type
- return arraylist using the return command
- traverse arraylist through for loops and while loops
- get() to get an element
- size() to get size
