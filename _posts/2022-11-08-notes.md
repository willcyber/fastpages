## Unit 1

int, boolean, char, and double are primitives
Strings and other classes are objects
Compare primitives with == and objects with .equals()
Objects have properties while primitives do not

## Unit 2

Objects are instances
Methods have to specify return type which can be void, or nothing
Static methods tied with the class and defined once across all instances
Method overloading is when multiple methods with the same name have different parameters

## Unit 4

While loops run when conditional is true
For loops defines a variable that changes every loop and runs when the conditional is true
Nested iteration can be good in situations
Enhanced for loops can loop through all elements in an array but the array cannot be modified when it is looping

## Unit 5

Classes have properties and methods
Properties store information about each object
private and public
Methods runs code
Getter and setter methods are coded to modify private attributes

## Unit 6

Arrays are objects defined by type[] name = new type[size] or initialized with elements using type[] name = new type[]{a,b,c,...}
Loops an enhanced can iterate through arrays
Index goes from 0 to size-1
Algorithms can be used to modify or get info about arrays
