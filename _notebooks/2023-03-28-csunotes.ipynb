    "It was very cool learning each of their journeys and how CSU opened so many doors. Although I don't plan on going to CSU, I learned lots of great advice on loans and scholarships. It was also interesting learning how much their internships paid them. Overall, this was a cool oppurtunity to learn about the college experiece from current college students!"
