<p>Insights</p>

<p>This panel really helped me to see how practical CS is in a variety of majors. Computer Science really can be applied to anything. I really resonated with Allison choosing talking about Cognitive Science. I never knew that you could major psychology with computer science. I will definitely check out the other submajors for computer science and choose one that I enjoy doing. I am leaning towards cybersecurity + comp sci rn. In addition, it was comforting knowing that others also faced many challenges in computer science. I liked how Anthony brought up his challenge of looking through other people’s Linkedins and feeling like he wasn’t good enough. His advice on just focusing on what you are doing is really good and beneficial to me. It was also interesting learning what the interns at Northrop Grumman do.</p>
